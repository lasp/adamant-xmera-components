--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This is a unit test suite for the Torque Thr Force Mapping component
package Torque_Thr_Force_Mapping_Tests.Implementation is

   -- Test data and state:
   type Instance is new Torque_Thr_Force_Mapping_Tests.Base_Instance with private;
   type Class_Access is access all Instance'Class;

   -- Fixture procedures:
   overriding procedure Set_Up_Test (Self : in out Instance);
   overriding procedure Tear_Down_Test (Self : in out Instance);

   -- A commanded torque about each body axis is reproduced by the mapped thruster
   -- forces, with no force commanded.
   overriding procedure Test_Pure_Torque (Self : in out Instance);
   -- A zero torque command produces zero thruster force on every thruster.
   overriding procedure Test_Zero_Command (Self : in out Instance);
   -- Every mapped thruster force is non negative and at least one is zero.
   overriding procedure Test_Min_Shift (Self : in out Instance);
   -- Applying a new thruster geometry changes the mapping used on the next tick.
   overriding procedure Test_Parameter_Update (Self : in out Instance);
   -- A commanded force set through the parameter is mapped onto the thrusters
   -- together with the torque, and a zero force restores the torque only mapping.
   overriding procedure Test_Force_Parameter (Self : in out Instance);
   -- A configuration the algorithm rejects is refused at parameter staging.
   overriding procedure Test_Invalid_Parameter (Self : in out Instance);
   -- Ensure a data dependency with the wrong identifier is treated as a wiring
   -- defect and fails the tick's assertion.
   overriding procedure Test_Invalid_Data_Dependency (Self : in out Instance);

   -- Test data and state:
   type Instance is new Torque_Thr_Force_Mapping_Tests.Base_Instance with record
