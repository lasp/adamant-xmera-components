# Adamant Xmera Components

This repository provides a collection of [Adamant](https://github.com/lasp/adamant) components that wrap [Xmera](https://github.com/lasp/fp32-fsw-xmera) flight software algorithms.

Xmera algorithms are primarily implemented in C/C++. Each component in this project wraps a specific Xmera algorithm with Ada bindings and exposes its functionality as a native Adamant component that can be included in any flight assembly.
